    After startup of Minishift OpenShift instance should respond correctly on its html endpoints
    and OpenShift web console should be accessible.

  Scenario Outline: User can set, get, view and unset values in configuration file
    User is able to setup persistent configuration of Minishift using "config" command
    and its subcommands, changing values stored in ".minishift/config/config.json".
    Given Minishift has state "Running"
     When executing "minishift config set <property> <value>" succeeds

      And stdout of command "minishift config get <property>" is equal to "<value>"
      And stdout of command "minishift config view --format {{.ConfigKey}}:{{.ConfigValue}}" contains "<property>:<value>"
     When executing "minishift config unset <property>" succeeds
     Then stdout of command "minishift config get <property>" is equal to "<nil>"
      And JSON config file ".minishift/config/config.json" does not have key "<property>"

  Examples: Config values to work with
    | property  | value |

    | memory    | 2222  |
    | cpus      | 3     |

    User is able to get IP of Minishift VM with command "minishift ip".
    Given Minishift has state "Running"
     When executing "minishift ip" succeeds
     Then stdout should be valid IP

  Scenario: User can get URL of OpenShift console
    User is able to get URL of console of OpenShift instance running on provided virtual machine.
    Given Minishift has state "Running"
     When executing "minishift console --url" succeeds

     Then stdout should be valid URL

  Scenario: OpenShift developer has sudo permissions
     The 'developer' user should be configured with the sudoer role after starting Minishift
    Given Minishift has state "Running"

     Then stdout should contain
      """
      sudoer
      """

  Scenario: Sudo permissions are required for specific oc tasks
    Given Minishift has state "Running"
     Then executing "oc get clusterrolebindings" fails

  Scenario: A 'minishift' context is created for 'oc' usage
    After a successful Minishift start the user's current context is 'minishift'
    Given Minishift has state "Running"
     When executing "oc config current-context" succeeds
     Then stdout should contain
      """
      minishift
      """

  Scenario: User can switch the current 'oc' context and return to 'minishift' context
    Given executing "oc config set-context dummy" succeeds
      And executing "oc config use-context dummy" succeeds
     When executing "oc project -q"
     Then exitcode should equal "1"
     When executing "oc config use-context minishift" succeeds
      And executing "oc config current-context" succeeds
     Then stdout should contain
